### Homework 6 (20.10 - 03.11):
1. (4 points) The tic-tac-toe game. Console and GUI interfaces. Tests
for logical and console interface parts.
2. * (8 points) The same task as 1st one, but on an infinity field.
3. (4 points) Code review of 1st task.

### Homework 7 (27.10 - 10.11):
1. (4 points) A generic abstract class of an ordered list. It should implement `Comparable`. Two implementations: with arrays and with lists.
Custom `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods must be implemented.
You can't use containers from the standard library, except ordinary arrays. This task must be solved on Java.
2. (2 point) Rewrite previous task on Kotlin using data classes.

### Homework 8 (03.11 - 17.11):
1. (4 points) An `Iterable` implementation for containers from the problem 4.1.

### Homework 9 (17.11 - 01.12):
1. (2 points) An interpreter for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
It must be able to get text of a Brainfuck program and interpret it.
One of tests should be [hello world program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello_World.21).
2. (6 points) A compiler from [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) to JVM.
It must be able to get text of a Brainfuck program and generate an appropriate .class file.
One of tests should be [hello world program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello_World.21).
3. * (2 points) A compiler form [Petooh](https://github.com/Ky6uk/PETOOH) to JVM. Same rules.
4. ** (8 points) A converter from an ASCII text to a short Brainfuck program, which prints this text.
The best work is going to be awarded.
5. (4 points) Code review of 1st task. It should be completed till 24.11.
